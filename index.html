        <p>My path started in 2011 when I joined the ranks of ENKI, a web agency, as a web designer. Quickly I moved to development, more specifically to Drupal as a frontend and backend developer. It became an instant connection which is still very much strong to this day. With ENKI we received several digital awards for specific projects as well as an overall best digital agency in Slovenia for several years in a row.</p><p>After ENKI I founded my own company called Iuvo where I worked on full scope projects for clients all around the world. During this time I also received the prestigious Site of the day and Honorable mention awards on CSS Design Awards and Awwwards sites.</p><p>Later on I crossed paths and joined forces with AGILEDROP where my role became the team lead on projects spaning from e-commerce to big corporate websites to completely custom web applications.</p><p>My focus was always Drupal and my goal was to deliver the best possible solution in terms of UX/UI as well as code structure.</p><p>I'm also self-taught, so you can pretty much throw anything at me and I'll find my way around it.</p><p>During this time I have also attended several Drupal Camps and Drupal Dev Days across Europe where in some of them I also gave a session. I have also been involved in my local Drupal community, attending and helping organise meetups and camps.</p><p>Other than that I enjoy good food - including preparing it, with a side of good company. I'm also passionate about sports. Watch it, play it, all sorts of it. I also play football on a club level. Now you might be wondering which one. I'll give you a hint - it involves a round ball which you kick with your feet. Hence, the name.</p>
